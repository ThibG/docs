`glitch-soc` lets you chose which replies to see in your list timelines.

![settings](settings.png)

By selecting “no one”, only self-replies will show up in that list timeline.

By selecting “members of the list”, only replies to other members of the list
will show up.

By selecting “any followed user”, replies to anyone you follow will appear in
the list timeline.
