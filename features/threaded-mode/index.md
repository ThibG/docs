title: Threaded mode
---

`glitch-soc` adds a "threaded mode" feature to the toot compose interface.
This eases writing "threads" of several toots.

### Compose UI

Threaded mode is enabled by using the dropdown in the compose UI:

![compose](compose.png)

A reply is prepared as soon as the toot is sent, pre-filled with any used hashtag:

![compose-reply](compose-reply.png)

Discarding the reply will exit threaded mode.
